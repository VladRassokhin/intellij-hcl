* Syntax highlighting
* Autocompletion for [predefined methods](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/interpolation.html) 
* (WIP) Go to declaration on resources, providers, properties, etc.

### Terraform External Metadata

Starting from version 0.6.14 it's possible to use external source of Terraform model.
Previously plugins updates were necessary once something was updated in Terraform itself or providers.

Plugin reads metadata from specially-formatted json files located at (in order):
 * `TERRAFORM_GLOBAL_DIR/schemas` (intended for schemas for your custom providers/provisioners) and 
 * `TERRAFORM_GLOBAL_DIR/metadata-repo/terraform/model` (semi-automatically updated schemas) and
 * Plugin itself

Here `TERRAFORM_GLOBAL_DIR` stands for `$HOME/.terraform.d` on Linux/macOS and `%APPDATA%/terraform.d` on Windows.

:information_source: Recommended approach is to clone [special repo](https://github.com/VladRassokhin/terraform-metadata) as `TERRAFORM_GLOBAL_DIR/metadata-repo` 
and later update it from time to time.
:warning: As of plugin version 0.6.14 IntelliJ restart is required once model is updated

Linux/macOS user may use commands like:
```bash
# To initial clone
mkdir -p "$HOME/.terraform.d/"
git clone https://github.com/VladRassokhin/terraform-metadata "$HOME/.terraform.d/metadata-repo"

# To update metadata
git -C "$HOME/.terraform.d/metadata-repo" pull
# Don't forget to restart IntelliJ after that
```
